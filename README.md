# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation to make this website was to test what i have learned thus far about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git

I built this project to have somewhere to quickly and neatly store my notes for the programming bootcamp.

This websites solves the issue of having my notes saved in a bunch of different spots unorginized which would cause more stress during an already stressful time.

I learned and touched on the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. While also learning how they intertwine when making a website of my own.

## Usage

This website has many different purposes, one being, the ability to hold higlighted notes about different subjects covered and soon to be covered. It can be referred to when stuck due to the inability to remember a small detail about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript by checking the notes under each section. In the event that I would need to study for a tests on either of these subjects I could open the console within the website itself and the console would generate a random topic to study first.
